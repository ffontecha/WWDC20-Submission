# WWDC20 Submission
This is my WWDC 2020 Scholarship submission. Feel free to try this playground either on macOS 👩‍💻 or iPadOS 📱. This playground is about the Pomodoro Technique, with a little twist. Each time you create a new session (you type the duration of it) you’ll add tasks for you to achieve during the session, thus giving you an insight of your progress; that meaning how many of your goals you achieved during the duration of the session you created.

This playground's objective is to make people aware of the Pomodoro Technique and why it's important to manage our times, especially during this crazy times we live in.  Hope you guys like it! 😊
